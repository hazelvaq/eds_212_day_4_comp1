## Create vectors

```{r}
rain <- c(3,5,10.1,6) 

rain_scaled <- 5*rain

```

## Created Matrices

```{r}
my_values <- seq(from = 1, to = 10)

```

Create a matrix

```{r}
# Populates the matrix by column to row unless we specify we can change it to rows byrow = TRUE
my_matrix <- matrix(my_values, nrow =2, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# We don't have a complete set of our multiples that will fit in this matrix so if we have more elements in a sequence it'll repeat 
my_matrix <- matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 2, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#Combine sequence to matrix function
# Add tabs to make the code more readable by moving them to their own line 
matrixA <- matrix(data = seq(from = 2, to = 5, length = 10), 
                  nrow = 2,
                  ncol = 5, 
                  byrow =TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Matrix addition
my_matrix + matrixA

```
